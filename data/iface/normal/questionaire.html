The right to use EMUmail is personal to the User and may not be transferred to any other person or entity. The User is responsible for all of their use and for ensuring that anyone who uses this service along with the User fully complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

At EMUMAIL's option, any changes, modifications, additions, or deletions to this Agreement may be effective immediately. EMUMAIL may provide notice of such changes, modifications, additions, or deletions by any means in its sole and absolute discretion. These may include, but are not limited to, posting on the EMUMAIL web site, e-mail or by any other means by which the User gets notice of such changes. If the User uses EMUMAIL after such notice of a change to this Agreement, that use shall be deemed an acceptance by the User of such changes, modifications, additions or deletions.

	2.4.	The User shall not use EMUMAIL to violate any contractual provision of the online service provider from which the User is using EMUMAIL to access the User's e-mail.
	2.5.	The User shall not use EMUMAIL in a way which encourages others to commit a criminal offense or gives rise to civil liability or otherwise violates any law.

3. 	No Warranties.
	3.1.	THE USER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE USER'S USE OF EMUMAIL IS AT THE USER'S SOLE RISK. THE USER UNDERSTANDS AND EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT EMUMAIL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT EMUMAIL'S SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.

Under absolutely no circumstances of any kind or nature shall EMUMAIL its directors, shareholders, employees, officers, or assigns be responsible for any damages or injuries caused by any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use of information, whether for breach of contract, tortious behavior, negligence, or under any other cause of action.
