<a id="name" class="anchor">Name, Organization, Email</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>Customize the name, organization, and reply-to email address fields that appear in the headers of the email messages
you send.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="skin" class="anchor">"Skin" Selection</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>EMU Webmail allows you to completely change the look of the interface by selecting a different "Skin". Skins include new
colors, fonts, and graphics. As a Webmail user, you have the ability to select and use the EMU Webmail look you like best. EMU Webmail
administrators may add skins, customize skins, and even limit the use of skins. Contact your administrator with any specific skin questions
or requests.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="perpage" class="anchor">Messages Per Page</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>This option sets the number of messages per page that will appear in the message list when viewing a folder or your Inbox.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="reload" class="anchor">Seconds to Reload Index</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>EMU Webmail checks for new email automatically. Enter the time interval, in seconds, that you want EMU Webmail to wait between
checks. For example, 300 seconds means that EMU Webmail will check for new email every 5 minutes. If you enter a short time interval, your
connection may slow down due to the constant connections EMU Webmail will have to make with your server.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="protocol" class="anchor">Primary Mailhost Protocol</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>Select whether you want EMU Webmail to use IMAP or POP3 to check your email. Generally, IMAP is preferred because it is more
advanced than POP3. If you have IMAP folders and switch to POP3, your IMAP folders will not be accessible. It is advisable to use IMAP if
the server on which your account is held can support it. We advise users to check with their Administrators for further help.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="prefix" class="anchor">IMAP Prefix</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>You may need to specify the root directory where your IMAP folders are stored on your account's server for them to be displayed
and work properly. If your folders don't appear under IMAP Folders in the side menu, or if you see a long list of your files rather than actual
folders, try setting the IMAP prefix. On many servers, the IMAP prefix is "mail/". In some cases, it is "INBOX.". If you are not certain, find
out from your EMU Webmail administrator.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="synch" class="anchor">Don't Synchronize with POP Server</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>This option is only available if you use POP3. It only applies if you use another email checking program or service outside of
EMU Webmail. EMU Webmail synchronizes whatever you may do in the other program so that what you see in that program is exactly what you see in
EMU Webmail.<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, if you open your account with EMU Webmail and open it with another program, and delete a message with the other
program, EMU Webmail would also delete the same message so that your Inbox would be identical in EMU Webmail and the other program. Disable this
feature by placing a checkmark in this checkbox.<br>&nbsp;<br>Note, this is an advanced feature that we recommend using only once you
have determined if you want to synchronize or not. Frequent enabling and disabling of this feature may cause problems with your EMU Webmail
account.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="attachments" class="anchor">Automatically Display Attachments</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>If you receive a message with an attachment, EMU Webmail will attempt to display the attachment right in your message. Disable this
feature by removing the checkmark from this checkbox. When disabled, your attachments are all still accessible and will just require an extra
click.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="headers" class="anchor">Automatically Display Full Message Headers</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>Message headers are often large and contain information not particularly relevant to the simple reading of an email message. Full message
headers are disabled by default but may be enabled per-message via the <a href="webmail_read_message.html">Read Message</a> page. To always show full
message headers, place a checkmark in this checkbox.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="quotes" class="anchor">Reply with Quoted Message</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>Each time you reply to a message, the message you are replying to is quoted in the new message. Disable this feature by removing the
checkmark from this checkbox.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="spam" class="anchor">Real-time spam detection</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>The real-time spam detection in EMU Webmail utilizes <a href="http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/" target="_blank">MAPS (Mail Abuse Prevention
System)</a> to weed out known spam and junk mail. Enable this feature by placing a checkmark in this checkbox.</a><br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="filters" class="anchor">Automatically Apply Filters</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>Your may apply the filters set "active" in the <a href="webmail_filters.html">Filter Manager</a> to your email in one of two ways.
First, automatically, meaning that any time new email is downloaded, your filters are automatically applied. Second, manually, meaning that once
any new messages have been downloaded, they will be stored in your Inbox until action is taken on them.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you wish to have your
message automatically filtered, place a checkmark in the checkbox here or at the bottom of at the bottom of the
<a href="webmail_filters.html">Filter Manager</a> page. If you wish to <a href="webmail_inbox.html#filter">apply filters manually</a>, ensure
the checkbox does not have a checkmark, and an "Apply Filters" button will apply among the message controls in the Inbox and all folders.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="trash" class="anchor">Send Deleted Messages to "Trash" Folder</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>This feature sends deleted messages to a "Trash" folder rather than completely deleting them. This feature behaves like the 'Recycle
Bin' in Microsoft Windows. Disable this feature by removing the checkmark from this checkbox.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="signature" class="anchor">Email Signature</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>An email signature is a set of text that is added to the end of each email message sent from you account. Setting up an email
signature is as simple as typing it in the provided text box and saving the page.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><hr noshade>

<a id="default" class="anchor">Restore Default Settings</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>Clicking the "Restore Default Settings" button immediately returns the Account Info settings of the current account to that of a new
account. The changes are limited to the Account Info page and do not affect other account data, such as email, folders, mailboxes, filters, etc.
