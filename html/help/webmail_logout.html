<br>&nbsp;<br>
The link to "Logout" is located at the bottom of the main menu. Clicking "Logout" immediately ends your EMU Webmail session and returns you to the
<a href="webmail_login.html">Login</a> page.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If you have a private computer that no one else uses, you may choose to remain logged in most of the day.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
However, if you are accessing EMU Webmail on an insecure or publicly accessible computer, we strongly advise all users to logout when they are finished.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
It is important to note that simply going to another website from your EMU Webmail window is not considering logging out. Your session remains active and
unauthorized users may be able to use the browser's "Back" button to step back and access your EMU Webmail account.
